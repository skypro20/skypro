# Support Advisors to Serve Customers

Three main categories
1.	**Go-to supervisor**
2.	**Structured briefings**
3.	**Structured coaching systems**


## Go-to Supervisor
*Current Scenario:* 
1.	Over 50% of a team leader's time is spent in focused work like coachings, escalations, call monitoring and meetings. 
2.	Task switching makes team leaders inefficient in focused work and lack of real time intervention leads to mistakes by advisors. 
3.	Which result in audits like "why was this call transferred" and "why was a sale not pitched on this call".

*Proposal*
1.	There is a go-to supervisor responsible for real time intervention
2.	Maybe a tenured advisor instead of team leader
3.	One or two hours shift, and then next person takes over

*Key Metrics*
1.	Increase in efficiency of team leader
2.	Decrease in invalid transfers
3.	Increase in pitching for sales


## Structured Briefings
*Current Scenario:* 
1.	New or overtly technical call types leads to higher AHT as advisor does not know what needs to be done, leading to dissatisfied customers
2.	Which lead to lower NPS scores

*Proposal*
1.	A daily forum for advisors to share trending call types and new things that they have learnt
2.	Advisor takes five minutes daily to answer questions like "what i wish i knew yesterday" and "what microskill can i share today"
3.	Team leaders choose the best answers to be shared in team briefing daily before shift
4.	Comments from happy customers are read out to boost advisor confidence and morale

*Key Metrics*
1.	Which part of team briefing is most effective
2.	Lowered aht and repeats

## Structured Coaching Systems
*Current Scenario:* 
1.	Forty-five minutes weekly sessions with team leader where we listen to one or two calls for dissatisfied customers
2.	Sessions are interrupted due to real time intervention being needed or rescheduled due to callflow

*Proposal*
1.	Sandwich technique of feedback, positive negative and positive
2.	Focus equally on learning from own good calls, others' good calls, mistakes from bad calls
3.	Dedicated systems which advisor can access, independent of team leader, to take ownership and responsibility for own performance and feedback
4.	Short clips of decisive moments of calls, rather than full calls, as those moments determine the outcome of the conversation

*Key Metrics*
1.	Individual metric of NPS and STS and detractors
2.	Individual objection-handling skills

## Overall Plan
-	A pilot programme with two teams, one for OJT and one for relatively experienced advisors
-	Weekly dip checks 
-	Tracking standard metrics
-	Tracking individual objection-handling skills and process expertise
